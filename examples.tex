\section{Public Key Encryption Schemes}
\subsection{Another Look at \citet{br93}}
In this Section, we return on the example proof discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:tutorial} and rewrite it making use of the standard library and
advanced features of \EasyCrypt presented in this manual. The corresponding
\EasyCrypt \href{file:../examples/br93.ec}{proof script} can be found in the
public repository.

\subsection{El Gamal}
A security \href{file:../examples/elgamal.ec}{proof} for the El Gamal encryption scheme is available in the public
repository.

\subsection{Hashed El Gamal}
A security \href{file:../examples/hashed_elgamal.ec}{proof} for the hashed El Gamal encryption scheme is available in the
public repository.
