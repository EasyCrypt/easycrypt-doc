  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{simplify}
  Change the goal with its $\beta\iota\zeta\Lambda$-head normal-form, followed
  by one step of parallel, strong $\delta$-reduction if \ec{delta} is given.
  The $\delta$-reduction can be restricted to a set of defined symbols by
  replacing \ec{delta} by a non-empty sequence of targeted symbols. You can
  selectively change the goal with its $\beta$-head normal form
  (resp. $\iota$, $\zeta$, $\Lambda$-head normal form) by using the tactic
  \ec{beta} (resp. \ec{iota}, \ec{zeta}, \ec{logic}). These tactics can be
  combined together, separated by spaces, to perform head reduction by any
  combination of the rule sets.
