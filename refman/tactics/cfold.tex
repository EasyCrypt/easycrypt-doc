\begin{tactic}{cfold}
  \begin{tsyntax}{cfold $\;c$ ! $\;m$}
    Fails unless $n\geq 1$ and $m\geq 0$.  If the goal's conclusion is
    an \hl statement judgement in which statement $c$ of the
    judgement's program is an ordinary assignment statement in which
    constant values are assigned to local identifiers, and the
    following statement block of length $m$ does not write any of
    those identifiers, then replace all occurrences of the assigned
    identifiers in that statement block by the constants assigned to
    them, and move the assignment statement to after the modified
    statement block.

    \medskip For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    from which
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-2.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-2.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    from which
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-3.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-3.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    from which
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-4.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/cfold/1-4.1.ec}{}{}{}{}

  \begin{tsyntax}{cfold\{1\} $\;c$ ! $\;m$ | cfold\{2\} $\;c$ ! $\;m$}
    Like the \hl version, but operating on the designed program of
    a \prhl judgement's conclusion.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{cfold\{1\} $\;c$ | cfold\{2\} $\;c$}
    Like the general cases, but where $m$ is set so as to be the
    number of statements after the assignment statement.
  \end{tsyntax}
