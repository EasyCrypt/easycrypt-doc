\begin{tactic}{while}
  \begin{tsyntax}{while $\;I$}
  In \prhl and \hl, as well as upper-bounding \phl judgments, performs
  a weakest precondition computation over a loop using \ec{I} as
  invariant. This generates two subgoals: one explaining that \ec{I}
  is a valid loop invariant, and the other explaining that the
  invariant is initially true and that it is sufficient to establish
  the current postcondition.

  \bigskip
  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/while/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/while/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goals
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/while/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/while/1-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}

  \begin{tsyntax}{while $\;I$ $\;v$}
  Where \ec{v} is an integer-valued expression. In \phl, performs a
  weakest precondition computation over a loop, using \ec{I} as
  invariant and \ec{v} as a decreasing variant to prove
  termination. In addition to the two invariant-related subgoals (see
  above), two subgoals regarding the variant are generated; one
  requiring that the variant be less than 0 exactly when the loop
  condition is false, and the other requiring that the variant
  decreases strictly.
