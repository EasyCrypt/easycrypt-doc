\begin{tactic}{proc}
  \begin{tsyntax}{proc}
    Turn a goal whose conclusion is a \prhl, \phl or \hl judgement
    involving \emph{concrete} procedure(s) into one whose conclusion
    is a statement judgement by replacing the concrete procedure(s) by
    their body/ies. Assertions about \ec{res}/\ec{res\{$i$\}} are turned
    into ones about the value(s) returned by the procedure(s).

  \bigskip
  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goal
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{proc $\;I$}
    Reduce a goal whose conclusion is a \prhl (resp., \hl) judgement
    involving an \emph{abstract} procedure to goals whose conclusions
    are \prhl (resp., \hl) judgements on the oracles the procedure may
    query, plus goals with ambient logic conclusions checking the
    original judgement's pre- and postconditions allow such
    a reduction.

  \bigskip
  For example, given the declarations
  \ecinput{examps/tactics/proc/2.ec}{}{3-24}{}
  if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/2-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/2-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goals
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/2-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/2-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/2-1.3.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/2-1.4.ec}{}{}{}{}
  The tactic would fail without the module restriction \ec{T\{Or\}} on
  \ec{M}, as then \ec{M} could directly manipulate \ec{Or.x}.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{proc $\;B$ $\;I$}
    Like \ec{proc $\;I$}, but just for \prhl judgements and uses
    ``upto-bad'' (upto-failure) reasoning, where the ``bad'' (failure)
    event, $B$, is evaluated in the second program's memory, and the
    invariant $I$ only holds up to the point when failure occurs.  In
    addition to subgoals whose conclusions are \prhl judgments
    involving the oracles the abstract procedure may query, subgoals
    are generated that check that: the original judgement's pre- and
    postconditions support the reduction; the abstract procedure is
    lossless, assuming the losslessness of the oracles it may query;
    the oracles used by the abstract procedure in the first program
    are lossless once the bad event occurs; and the oracles used by
    the abstract procedure in the second program guarantee the
    stability of the failure event with probability 1.

  \bigskip
  For example, suppose we have the following declarations
  \ecinput{examps/tactics/proc/3.ec}{}{3-40}{}
  Then, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{}
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goals
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.3.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.4.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.5.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-1.6.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{proc $\;B$ $\;I$ $\;J$}
    Like \ec{proc $\;B$ $\;I$}, but where the extra invariant, $J$,
    holds \emph{after} failure has occurred.

  \bigskip
  For example, given the declarations of the \ec{proc $\;B$ $\;I$} example,
  if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goals
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.3.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.4.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.5.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/3-2.6.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{proc*}
    Reduce a \prhl (resp., \phl) judgement to a \prhl (resp., \phl)
    statement judgement involving calls (resp., a call) to the
    procedures (resp., procedure).

  \bigskip
  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/4-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/4-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goal
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/proc/4-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}

  \paragraph{Remark.}
  This tactic is particularly useful in combination with
  \rtactic{inline} when faced with a \prhl judgment where one of the
  procedures is concrete and the other is abstract.
