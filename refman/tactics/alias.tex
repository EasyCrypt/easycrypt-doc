\begin{tactic}{alias}
  \begin{tsyntax}{alias $\;c$ with $\;x$}
    If the goal's conclusion is an \hl statement judgement whose
    program's $c$th statement is an assignment statement, and $x$ is
    an identifier, then replace the assignment statement by the
    following two statements:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item an assignment statement of the same kind as the original
      assignment statement (ordinary, random, procedure call) whose
      left-hand side is $x$, and whose right-hand side is the
      right-hand side of the original assignment statement;

    \item an ordinary assignment statement whose left-hand side is
      the left-hand side of the original assignment statement,
      and whose right-hand side is $x$.
    \end{itemize}
    If $x$ is a local variable of the program, a fresh name is
    generated by adding digits to the end of $x$.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{alias $\;c$}
    Equivalent to \ec{alias $\;c$ with x}.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{alias $\;c$ $\;x$ = $\;e$}
    If the program has an $c$th statement, and the expression $e$ is
    well-typed in the context of the program, insert before the $c$th
    statement an ordinary assignment statement whose left-hand side is
    $x$ and whose right-hand side is $e$.
    If $x$ is a local variable of the program, a fresh name is
    generated by adding digits to the end of $x$.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{alias\{1\} $\;\cdots$ | alias\{2\} $\;\cdots$}
    The \prhl versions of the preceding forms, where the aliasing
    is done in the designated program.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \bigskip For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/alias/1-1.0.ec} then running
  \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/alias/1-1.ec} produces the
  goal \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/alias/1-1.1.ec}
  from which running
  \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/alias/1-2.ec} produces the
  goal \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/alias/1-2.1.ec}
  from which running
  \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/alias/1-3.ec} produces the
  goal \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/alias/1-3.1.ec}
\end{tactic}
