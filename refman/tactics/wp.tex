\begin{tactic}{wp}
  \begin{tsyntax}{wp}
    If the goal's conclusion is a \prhl, \phl or \hl statement
    judgement, consume the longest suffix(es) of the conclusion's
    program(s) consisting entirely of statements built-up from
    ordinary assignments (not random assignments or procedure call
    assignments) and \ec{if} statements, replacing the conclusion's
    postcondition by the weakest precondition $R$ such that the
    statement judgement consisting of $R$, the consumed suffix(es)
    and the conclusion's original postcondition holds.

    \bigskip For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/wp/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/wp/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/wp/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{wp $\;n_1$ $\;n_2$}
    In \prhl, let \ec{wp} consume \emph{exactly} $n_1$ statements of
    the first program and $n_2$ statements of the second
    program. Fails if this isn't possible.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{wp $\;n$}
    In \phl and \hl, let \ec{wp} consume \emph{exactly} $n$ statements
    of the program. Fails if this isn't possible.
  \end{tsyntax}
\end{tactic}
