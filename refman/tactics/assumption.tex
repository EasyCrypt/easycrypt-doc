\begin{tactic}{assumption}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{assumption}
    Search in the context for a hypothesis that is convertible to the
    goal's conclusion, solving the goal if one is found. Fail if none
    can be found.

    For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/assumption/1-1.0.ec} then
    running
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/assumption/1-1.ec} solves
    the goal.
