\begin{tactic}{trivial}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{trivial}
  Try to solve the goal by using a mixture of low-level tactics.
  This tactic is called by the introduction pattern \ec{//}.

  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/trivial/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/trivial/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  solves the goal.
  On the other hand, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/trivial/2-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/trivial/2-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  leaves the goal unchanged.
  \end{tsyntax}
  \fix{Be a bit more detailed about what this tactic does?}
