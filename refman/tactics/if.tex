\begin{tactic}{if}
  \begin{tsyntax}{if}
  If the goal's conclusion is a \prhl statement judgement whose programs
  both \emph{begin} with \ec{if} statements, reduce the goal to
  three subgoals:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One whose conclusion is the ambient logic formula asserting that
    the equivalence of the boolean expressions of the \ec{if} statements
    in their respective memories holds given that the statement judgement's
    precondition holds in those memories.

  \item One in which the \ec{if} statements have been replaced by
    their ``then'' parts, and where the assertion of the truth of
    the first \ec{if} statement's boolean expression in the first
    program's memory has been added to the conclusion's precondition.

  \item One in which the \ec{if} statements have been replaced by
    their ``else'' parts, and where the assertion of the falsity of
    the first \ec{if} statement's boolean expression in the first
    program's memory has been added to the conclusion's precondition.
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip
  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goals
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/1-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/1-1.3.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{if\{1\} | if\{2\}}
    If the goal's conclusion is a \prhl judgement in which the first
    statement of the specified program is an \ec{if} statement,
    then reduce the goal to two subgoals:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One where the \ec{if} statement has been replaced by its
      ``then'' part, and the precondition has been augmented by the
      assertion that the \ec{if} statement's boolean expression is true
      in the specified program's memory.

    \item One where the \ec{if} statement has been replaced by its
      ``else'' part, and the precondition has been augmented by the
      assertion that the \ec{if} statement's boolean expression is false
      in the specified program's memory.
    \end{itemize}

    For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/2-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then running
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/2-1.ec}{}{}{}{} produces the
    goals \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/2-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{} and
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/2-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{if}
    If the goal's conclusion is an \hl judgement whose first statement
    is an \ec{if} statement, then reduce the goal to two subgoals:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One where the \ec{if} statement has been replaced by its
      ``then'' part, and the precondition has been augmented by the
      assertion that the \ec{if} statement's boolean expression is true.

    \item One where the \ec{if} statement has been replaced by its
      ``else'' part, and the precondition has been augmented by the
      assertion that the \ec{if} statement's boolean expression is false.
    \end{itemize}

    For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/3-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then running
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/3-1.ec}{}{}{}{} produces the
    goals \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/3-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{} and
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/if/3-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
