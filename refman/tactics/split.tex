\begin{tactic}{split}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{split}
  Break an intrinsically conjunctive goal into its component subgoals.
  For instance, it can:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item close any goal that is convertible to \tct{true} or provable by \tct{reflexivity},
    \item replace a logical equivalence by the direct and indirect implication,
    \item replace a goal of the form \tct{f1 /\\ f2} by the two subgoals for \tct{f1} an
          \tct{f2}. The same applies for a goal of the form \tct{f1 && f2},
    \item replace an equality between $n$-tuples by $n$ equalities
          on their components.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{tsyntax}
\end{tactic}
