\begin{tactic}[have $\;\iota$: $\;\phi$]{have}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{have}
  Logical cut. Generate two subgoals: one for the cut formula $\phi$,
  and one for $\phi \Rightarrow G$ where $G$ is the current goal. Moreover,
  the intro-pattern \ec{$\iota$} is applied to the second subgoal.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{have $\;\iota$: $\;\phi$ by t}
  Attempts to use \ec{t} to close the first subgoal (corresponding to
  the cut formula $\phi$), and fails if impossible.
  \end{tsyntax}
\end{tactic}
