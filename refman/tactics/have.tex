\begin{tactic}[have $\;\iota$: $\;\phi$]{have}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{have}
    Logical cut. Generate two subgoals: one whose conclusion is the
    cut formula $\phi$, and one with conclusion \ec{$\phi$ =>
      $\;\psi$} where $\psi$ is the current goal's
    conclusion. Moreover, the introduction pattern \ec{$\iota$} is
    applied to the second subgoal.

  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/have/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/have/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goals
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/have/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  and
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/have/1-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{have $\;\iota$: $\;\phi$ by $\;\tau$}
  Attempts to use tactic $\tau$ to close the first subgoal (corresponding to
  the cut formula $\phi$), and fails if impossible.
  \end{tsyntax}
\end{tactic}
