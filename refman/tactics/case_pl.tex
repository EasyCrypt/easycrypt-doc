  \begin{tsyntax}{case $\;e$}
    If the goal's conclusion is a \prhl, \hl or \phl \emph{statement}
    judgement and $e$ is well-typed in the goal's context, split the
    goal into two goals:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a first goal in which $e$ is added as a conjunct to the
      conclusion's precondition; and

    \item a second goal in which $!e$ is added as a conjunct to the
      conclusion's precondition.
    \end{itemize}

    \medskip For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goals
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    and
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/1-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
    And if the current goal is
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/2-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/2-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goals
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/2-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    and
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/case_pl/2-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}
