\begin{tactic}{call}
  All variants of the \tct{call} tactic implicitly make use of a frame
  rule, based on a ``may modify'' analysis.

  \begin{tsyntax}{call (_: P ==> Q)}
  Compute the precondition of a procedure call using the given
  specification for the procedure. As a side-goal, prove that the
  procedure fulfills the given specification.

  As with other tactics, the specification \tct{(_: P ==> Q)} can be
  replaced with a lemma from which the specification is inferred.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{call (_: I)}
  Uses invariant \tct{I} to infer a specification for use with
  \tct{tactic}.
  %%
  In \prhl, equivalent to
  \tct{call (_: =$\{\Arg\}$ /\\ I ==> =$\{\Res\}$ /\\ I); first proc I.}
  %%
  In \phl and \hl, equivalent to
  \tct{call (_: I ==> I); first proc I.}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{call (_: B, I)}
  On \prhl abstract procedures only.
  Equivalent to \tct{call (_: $\neg$B /\\ =$\{\Arg\}$ /\\ I ==> $\neg$B => =$\{\Res\}$ /\\ I); first proc B I.}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{call (_: B, I, I')}
  On \prhl abstract procedures only.
  Equivalent to \tct{call (_: $\neg$B /\\ =$\{\Arg\}$ /\\ I ==> if $\neg$B then =$\{\Res\}$ /\\ I else I')); first proc B I I'.}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \textbf{Note:} When using the invariant-based variants of
  \tct{call}, error messages may be originating from the underlying
  application of \rtactic{proc}. In particular, when using them to
  deal with abstract procedure calls, the invariant \emph{should not}
  refer to memory locations the abstract procedure may modify.
\end{tactic}
