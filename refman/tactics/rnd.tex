\begin{tactic}{rnd}
  \begin{tsyntax}{rnd | rnd f | rnd f f$^{-1}$}
  In \prhl, compute the probabilistic weakest precondition of two
  random samplings whose results are equally distributed, by
  exhibiting a probability-preserving bijection between the two
  distributions. When \ec{f$^{-1}$} is \ec{f}, it can be
  omitted. When \ec{f} is the identity, both \ec{f} and
  \ec{f$^{-1}$} can be omitted.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{rnd | rnd E}
  In \phl, compute the probabilistic weakest precondition of a random
  sampling with respect to event \ec{E}. When \ec{E} is not
  specified, it is inferred from the current postcondition.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{rnd}
  In \hl, compute the possibilistic weakest precondition of a random
  sampling operation.
