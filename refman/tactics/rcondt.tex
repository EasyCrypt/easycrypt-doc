    If the goal's conclusion is an \hl statement judgement whose $n$th
    statement is an \ec{if} statement, reduce the goal to two
    subgoals.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One whose concludion is an \hl statement judgement whose
      precondition is the original goal's precondition, program is the
      first $n-1$ statements of the original goal's program, and
      postcondition is the boolean expression of the \ec{if}
      statement.
   
    \item One whose conclusion is an \hl statement judgement that's
      the same as that of the original goal except that the \ec{if}
      statement has been replaced by its then part.
    \end{itemize}

    \medskip For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/rcondt/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/rcondt/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goals
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/rcondt/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{} and
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/rcondt/1-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}

    If the goal's conclusion is a \prhl statement judgement where the
    $n$th statement of the designated program is an \ec{if} statement,
    reduce the goal to two subgoals.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One whose conclusion is an \hl statement judgement whose
      precondition is the original goal's precondition, program is the
      first $n-1$ statements of the original goal's designated
      program, and postcondition is the boolean expression of the
      \ec{if} statement. Actually, the \hl statement judgement is
      universally quantified by a memory of the non-designated
      program, and references in the precondition to variables of the
      non-designated program are interpreted in that memory.
   
    \item One whose conclusion is a \prhl statement judgement that's
      the same as that of the original goal except that the \ec{if}
      statement has been replaced by its then part.
    \end{itemize}
