\begin{tactic}{skip}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{skip} If the goal's conclusion is a statement
    judgement whose program(s) are empty, reduce it to the goal whose
    conclusion is the ambient logic formula \ec{$P$ => $\;Q$}, where
    $P$ is the original conclusion's precondition, and $Q$ is its
    postcondition.

  \bigskip
  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/skip/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/skip/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goal
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/skip/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}

%  \textbf{Note:} Note that the \phl rule forces the bound of the goal
%  to be 1. If you end up with an empty program and a bound other than
%  1, you might want to use \rtactic{hoare} or \rtactic{conseq}. If
%  neither of these work, you should probably have used \rtactic{seq}
%  or \rtactic{phoare split} earlier on in your proof.
