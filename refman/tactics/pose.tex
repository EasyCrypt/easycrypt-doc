\begin{tactic}[pose x := $\;\pi$]{pose}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{pose}
  Search for the first subterm \ec{p} of the goal matching $\pi$ and
  leading to the full instantiation of the pattern. Then introduce,
  after instantiation, the local definition \ec{x := p} and abstract
  all occurrences of \ec{p} in the goal as \ec{x}. An occurence
  selector can be used (see \rtactic{rewrite}).
