\begin{tactic}[pose x := $\;\pi$]{pose}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{pose}
  Search for the first subterm of the goal matching \ec{p} and leading
  to the full instantiation of the pattern. Then introduce, after
  instantiation, the local definition \ec{x := $\;\pi$} and abstract
  all instantiated occurrences of \ec{p} in the goal by \ec{x}. An
  occurence selector can be used (see \rtactic{rewrite}).
