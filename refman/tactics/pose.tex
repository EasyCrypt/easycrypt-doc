\begin{tactic}[pose $\;x\!$ := $\;\pi$]{pose}
  \begin{tsyntax}[empty]{pose}
    Search for the first subterm $t$ of the goal's conclusion matching
    $\pi$ and leading to the full instantiation of the pattern. Then
    introduce to the goal's context, after instantiation, the local
    definition \ec{$x\!$ := $\;t$}, and abstract all occurrences of $t$
    in the goal's conclusion as $x$. An occurence selector can be used
    (see Subsection~\ref{subsec:occsels}).

  For example, if the current goal is
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/pose/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
  running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/pose/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  produces the goal
  \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/pose/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}
\end{tactic}
