\begin{tactic}{splitwhile}
  \begin{tsyntax}{splitwhile $\;n$ : $\;e$}
    If the goal's conclusion is an \hl statement judgement whose $n$th
    statement is a \ec{while} statement and $e$ is a well-typed
    boolean expression in the \ec{while} statement's context, then
    insert before the \ec{while} statement a copy of the \ec{while}
    statement in which $e$ is added as a conjunct of the statement's
    boolean expression.

    \medskip For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{splitwhile\{1\} $\;n$ : $\;e$ | splitwhile\{2\} $\;n$ : $\;e$}
    If the goal's conclusion is a \prhl statement judgement where the
    $n$th statement of the designated program is a \ec{while}
    statement and $e$ is a well-typed boolean expression in the
    \ec{while} statement's context, then insert before the \ec{while}
    statement a copy of the \ec{while} statement in which $e$ is added
    as a conjunct of the statement's boolean expression.

    \medskip For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-2.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-2.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-2.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    from which
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-3.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/splitwhile/1-3.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
