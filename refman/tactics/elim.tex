\begin{tactic}[elim | elim /$L$]{elim}
  \begin{tsyntax}{elim}
    Eliminates the top assumption of the goal's conclusion, generating
    subgoals that are dependent upon the kind of assumption
    eliminated. \emph{This tactic can be followed by
    the generalization tactical---see Subsection~\ref{subsec:introgen}.}

    \ec{elim} mostly works identically to \rtactic{case}, the exception
    being inductive datatype and the integers (for which a built-in
    induction principle is applied---see the other form).

    Consider the inductive datatype declaration:
\begin{easycrypt}{}{}
type tree = [Leaf | Node of bool & tree & tree].
\end{easycrypt}
    Then, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{}
    running \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goals
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    and
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/1-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{elim /$L$}
    Eliminates the top assumption of the goal's conclusion using the
    supplied induction principle lemma. \emph{This tactic can be
      followed by the generalization tactical---see
      Subsection~\ref{subsec:introgen}.}
    For example, consider the declarations
\begin{easycrypt}{}{}
type tree = [Leaf | Node of bool & tree & tree].
op rev (tr : tree) : tree =
  with tr = Leaf => Leaf
  with tr = Node b tr1 tr2 => Node b (rev tr1) (rev tr2).
\end{easycrypt}
and suppose we've already proved
\begin{easycrypt}{}{}
lemma IndPrin :
  forall (p : tree -> bool) (tr : tree),
  p Leaf =>
  (forall (b : bool) (tr1 tr2 : tree),
   p tr1 => p tr2 => p(Node b tr1 tr2)) =>
  p tr.
\end{easycrypt}
    Then, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/2-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{}
    running \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/2-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goals
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/2-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    and
    \ecinput{examps/parts/tactics/elim/2-1.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

\smallskip
When we consider the \ec{Int} theory in Chapter~\ref{chap:library},
we'll discuss the induction principle on the integers.
