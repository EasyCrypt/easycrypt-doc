  \begin{tsyntax}{seq $\;n_1$ $\;n_2$ : $\;R$}
    \textbf{\prhl sequence rule.} If $n_1$ and $n_2$ are natural
    numbers and the goal's conclusion is a \prhl statement judgement
    with precondition $P$, postcondition $Q$ and such that the lengths
    of the first and second programs are at least $n_1$ and $n_2$,
    respectively, then reduce the goal to two subgoals:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A first goal whose conclusion has precondition $P$,
      postcondition $R$, first program consisting of the first $n_1$
      statements of the original goal's first program, and second
      program consisting of the first $n_2$ statements of the original
      goal's second program.

    \item A second goal whose conclusion has precondition $R$,
      postcondition $Q$, first program consisting of all but the first
      $n_1$ statements of the original goal's first program, and
      second program consisting of all but the first $n_2$ statements
      of the original goal's second program.
    \end{itemize}

  \textbf{\hl sequence rule.} If $n$ is a natural
    number and the goal's conclusion is an \hl statement judgement
    with precondition $P$, postcondition $Q$ and such that the length
    of the program is at least $n$, then reduce the goal to two subgoals:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A first goal whose conclusion has precondition $P$,
      postcondition $R$, and program consisting of the first $n$
      statements of the original goal's program.

    \item A second goal whose conclusion has precondition $R$,
      postcondition $Q$, and program consisting of all but the first
      $n$ statements of the original goal's program.

%  \begin{tsyntax}{seq $\ n$: R $\ \delta_1\ \delta_2\ \delta_3\ \delta_4$ I}
%  Non-relational probabilistic sequence rule. Argument \ec{I} is
%  optional (and defaults to $\mathsf{true}$). When one of
%  $(\delta_1,\delta_2)$ (resp. $(\delta_3,\delta_4)$) is 0, the other
%  can be replaced with a wildcard \ec{_}, and the corresponding goal
%  is not generated, as it is not relevant to the proof. When none of
%  the $\delta$s are given, the following default values are used:
%  $\delta_1 = 1$, $\delta_2 = \delta$, $\delta_3 = 0$.

%  \textbf{Note:} Since most tactics implicitly apply the \rtactic{seq}
%  rule, most \phl tactics take optional final arguments corresponding
%  to the $\delta$s and \ec{I}.
