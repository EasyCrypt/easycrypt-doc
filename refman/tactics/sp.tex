\begin{tactic}{sp}
  \begin{tsyntax}{sp}
    If the goal's conclusion is a \prhl, \phl or \hl statement
    judgement, consume the longest prefix(es) of the conclusion's
    program(s) consisting entirely of statements built-up from
    ordinary assignments (not random assignments or procedure call
    assignments) and \ec{if} statements, replacing the conclusion's
    precondition by the strongest postcondition $R$ such that the
    statement judgement consisting of the conclusion's original
    precondition, the consumed prefix(es) and $R$
    holds.

    \bigskip For example, if the current goal is
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/sp/1-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{} then
    running \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/sp/1-1.ec}{}{}{}{}
    produces the goal
    \ecinput{../examps/parts/tactics/sp/1-1.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{sp $\;n_1$ $\;n_2$}
    In \prhl, let \ec{sp} consume \emph{exactly} $n_1$ statements of
    the first program and $n_2$ statements of the second
    program. Fails if this isn't possible.
  \end{tsyntax}

  \begin{tsyntax}{sp $\;n$}
    In \phl and \hl, let \ec{sp} consume \emph{exactly} $n$ statements
    of the program. Fails if this isn't possible.
  \end{tsyntax}
\end{tactic}
