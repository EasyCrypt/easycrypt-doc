A statment patterns is an extension of statments.

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
  \hline
  Blocks & \\
  \hline
  \texttt{\{\}} & empty statment \\
  \texttt{\{s\}} & start and end anchors around \texttt{s} \\
  \texttt{\{s]} & start anchor at the beginning of \texttt{s} \\
  \texttt{[s\}} & end anchor at the end of \texttt{s} \\
  \texttt{[s]} & find \texttt{s} at any position in the statments, 
                 without looking into possible branches \\
  \texttt{<s>} & find \texttt{s} at any position in the statments, 
                 and looking into possible branches \\

  \hline
  \texttt{\_} & any sequence of statments \\
  \texttt{n!\_} & a sequence of  \texttt{n} statments \\
  \texttt{s as X} &  \texttt{s} that is associated with the name  \texttt{X}\\
  \texttt{X} & interpreted as : \texttt{\_ as X} \\
  \hline
  \texttt{!s} & repeat  \texttt{s}, can be zero time \\

%                      it's the same behaviour as ``;''\\

  \texttt{if \_ bt else bf} & a \texttt{if} statment where  \texttt{bt} is the 
  block matched in the branch true's corpse,\\

  \texttt{while \_ b} & a \texttt{while} branch where the block  \texttt{b}
  is matched in the corpse of the loop\\
