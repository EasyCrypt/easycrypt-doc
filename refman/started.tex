\section{About this Documentation}

The source for this document, along with the macros and language
definitions used, are available in the github repository. Feel free to
use the language definitions to typeset your \EasyCrypt-related
documents, and to contribute improvements to the macros if you have
any.

This document is intended as a user manual for the \EasyCrypt tool,
and not as a tutorial on how to build a cryptographic proof, or how to
perform interactive proofs. We attempt to provide some detailed
examples in later sections of this document, but they are still simple
and may still seem obscure even with a good understanding of the
issues. We recommend experimenting.
