\chapter{Tactics}
\label{chap:tactics}

Proofs in \EasyCrypt are carried out using \emph{tactics}, logical
rules embodying general reasoning principles, which transform the
current lemma (or \emph{goal}) into zero or more
\emph{subgoals}---sufficient conditions for the lemma/goal to
hold. Simple ambient logic goals may be automatically proved using SMT
solvers.

In this chapter, we introduce \EasyCrypt's proof engine, before
describing the tactics for \EasyCrypt's four logics: ambient, \prhl,
\phl and \hl.

\section{Proof Engine}

\EasyCrypt's proof engine works with goal lists, where a \emph{goal}
has two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{context} consisting of a
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a set of type variables, and

  \item an \emph{ordered} set of \emph{assumptions}, consisting of
    identifiers with their types, memories, module names with their
    module types and restrictions, local definitions, and
    \emph{hypotheses}, i.e., formulas. An identifier's type may
    involve the type variables, the local definitions and formulas may
    involve the type variables, identifiers, memories and module
    names.
  \end{itemize}

\item A \emph{conclusion}, consisting of a single formula, with
  the same constraints as the assumption formulas.
\end{itemize}
Informally, to prove a goal, one must show the conclusion to be true,
given the truth of the hypotheses, for all valid instantiations
of the assumption identifiers, memories and module names.

For example,
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp0-2.1.ec}{}{}{}{}
is a goal.
And, in the context of the declarations
\ecinput{examps/tactics-examp2.ec}{}{3-11}{}{}
this is a goal:
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp2-2.0.ec}{}{}{}{}
The conclusion of this goal is just a nonlinear rendering of the formula
\begin{easycrypt}{}{}
phoare [G(X).g : G.x = n ==> G.x = n] = 1%r.
\end{easycrypt}
\EasyCrypt's pretty printer renders \prhl, \phl and \hl judgements
in such a nonlinear style when the judgements appear as
(as opposed to in) the conclusions of goals.

Internally, \EasyCrypt's proof engine also works with \prhl, \phl and
\hl judgments involving lists of statements rather than procedure
names, which we'll call \emph{statement judgements}, below. For
example, given this declaration
\ecinput{examps/tactics-examp1.ec}{}{3-9}{}{} this is an \phl
statement judgement:
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp1-3.0.ec}{}{}{}{} The pre- and
post-conditions of a statement judgement may refer to the parameters
and local variables of the \emph{procedure context} of the
conclusion---\ec{M.f} in the preceding example. They may also refer
to the memories \ec{&$1$} and \ec{&$2$} in the case of \prhl statement
judgements.  When a statement judgement appears anywhere other than as
the conclusion of a goal, the pretty printer renders it in abbreviated
linear syntax.  E.g., the preceding goal is rendered as
\begin{easycrypt}{}{}
hoare[if (x %% 3 = 1) {...} : x %% 3 = n ==> x %% 3 = n %% 2 + 1]
\end{easycrypt}
Statement judgements can't be directly input by the user.

We use the term \emph{program} to refer to \emph{either} a procedure
appearing in a \prhl, \phl or \hl judgement, \emph{or} a statement
list appearing in a \prhl, \phl or \hl statement judgement. In the
case of \prhl (statement) judgements, we speak of the \emph{left} and
\emph{right} programs, also using \emph{program 1} for the left
program, and \emph{program 2} for the right one. We will only speak of
a program's \emph{length} when it's a statement list we are referring
to. By the \emph{empty} program, we mean the statement list with no
statements.

When the proof of a lemma is begun, the proof engine starts out with
a single goal, consisting of the lemma's statement. E.g.,
the lemma
\ecinput{examps/tactics-examp0.ec}{}{1-3}{}{}
gives rise to the goal
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp0-1.0.ec}{}{}{}{}
For parameterized lemmas, the goal includes the lemma's parameters
as assumptions. E.g.,
\begin{easycrypt}{}{}
lemma PairEq (x x' : 'a) (y y' : 'b) :
  x = x' => y = y' => (x, y) = (x', y').
\end{easycrypt}
gives rise to
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp0-2.0.ec}{}{}{}{}

\EasyCrypt's tactics, when applicable, reduce the first goal to zero
or more subgoals.  E.g., if the first goal is
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp1-3.0.ec}{}{}{}{}
then applying the \ec{if} tactic (handle a conditional) reduces
(replaces) this goal with the two goals
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp1-3.1.ec}{}{}{}{} and
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp1-3.2.ec}{}{}{}{}
(leaving the remaining goals, if any, unchanged).
If the first goal is
\ecinput{examps/parts/tactics-examp1-6.0.ec}{}{}{}{}
then applying the \ec{smt} tactic (try to solve the goal using
SMT provers) solves the goal, i.e., replaces it with no subgoals.
Applying a tactic may fail; in this case an error message is issued
and the list of goals is left unchanged.

A lemma's proof may be saved, using the step \ec{qed}, when the list
of goals becomes empty. And this must be done before anything else may
be done.

\paragraph{Remark.}
In the descriptions of \EasyCrypt's tactics given in the following two
sections, unless otherwise specified, you should assume that the
subgoals to which a tactic reduces a goal have the same contexts as
that original goal.
